Part 1: Write your message here from GitHub
This is me typing from GitHub!

Task 1: 
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
git fetch tells you what changes have been made to the master branch which then allows you to know 
whether your local respository is up to date or not using git status.

Task 2:
// Under this line, describe the difference between Git and GitHub
